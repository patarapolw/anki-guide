# [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) Guide

## What is Anki?

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a flashcard application available for desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux). It is primarily offline and syncing to online is possible, but optional.

There are also mobile versions for iOS (AnkiMobile, I think) and Android (AnkiDroid). iOS version is also made by the Anki creator, but Android is made by a different team.

Personally, I use Anki on Windows and Linux and AnkiDroid on a smartphone and a tablet.

To get started, go to [HTML/JS/CSS - what are supported](/html-js-css-support.md).

## Hoped-to-have features

### Individual card-specific overrides

Wouldn't it be nice if some cards can have a special front side or back side?

### Card Fields

Templating might be easier this way, similar to individual card-specific overrides.

## Alternatives

Admittedly, I tried to create [Rep2recall](https://github.com/rep2recall/rep2recall), which uses not only a fully online database (no syncing problems), but also utilizes Handlebars templating language, which is probably more powerful than [mustache-ish templating](/html-js-css-support.md#templating) used in Anki (where I can't totally replicate as well). A goal of the project was to allow programmatic manipulation as well.

There is also https://kitsun.io/ where I haven't tried much.
